# CrowdSec Web UI API

All API routes return JSON unless a route explicitly redirects for OIDC login/callback. Routes are served below `/api`, or below `${BASE_PATH}/api` when `BASE_PATH` is configured. `GET /api/health` is always registered at the root path; when `BASE_PATH` is set, `${BASE_PATH}/api/health` is registered too.

The browser UI authenticates with the HTTP-only `crowdsec_web_ui_session` cookie. There is no bearer-token API in this codebase. Authentication is enabled for new installs by default; migrated databases from older unauthenticated versions stay disabled until `AUTH_ENABLED=true` is set. When auth is enabled, protected API routes return `401` without a valid session.

Protected application routes also ensure the backend can authenticate to CrowdSec LAPI. If LAPI login fails, they return `502`.

`PERMISSION_READ_ONLY=true` or a read-only user role blocks enforcement and management writes. Blocked requests return:

```json
{ "error": "Read-only mode is enabled", "code": "READ_ONLY" }
```

Read-only mode still allows user preferences and notification read-state writes.

## Common Behavior

### Pagination

List endpoints that support pagination use `page` and `page_size`. Pagination is enabled only when the `page` query parameter is present.

- `page` defaults to `1` and is clamped to at least `1`.
- `page_size` defaults to `50` and is clamped from `10` to `200`.
- Paginated responses use:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 50,
    "total": 0,
    "total_pages": 0,
    "unfiltered_total": 0
  },
  "selectable_ids": []
}
```

### Search and Filters

`GET /api/alerts` and `GET /api/decisions` support a structured `q` search when paginated. Search supports free text, quoted phrases, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `-`, grouping, field matching with `:`, exact matching with `=`, inequality with `<>`, and date comparisons with `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

Alert search fields: `id`, `scenario`, `message`, `ip`/`source`, `country`, `as`, `target`, `date`/`created`/`created_at`/`time`, `sim`/`simulation`, `machine`, `origin`.

Decision search fields: `id`, `alert`/`alert_id`, `scenario`/`reason`, `ip`/`value`, `country`, `as`, `target`, `date`/`created`/`created_at`/`time`, `action`, `type`, `status`, `duplicate`, `sim`/`simulation`, `machine`, `origin`.

Date range filters use `dateStart` and `dateEnd`. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for day buckets or values containing `T` for hour-level comparisons. `tz_offset` is an offset in minutes used for local bucket comparisons when the server has no fixed `TZ` configured.

## Health

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Public health check returning `{ "status": "ok" }`. |

## Auth

These routes are mounted below `/api/auth`. Auth setup/login routes are available without a session so onboarding and login can work.

## Alerts

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/alerts` | List synced alerts. Without `page`, returns an array. With `page`, returns a paginated response. |

Supported paginated alert filters: `q`, `ip`, `country`, `scenario`, `as`, `date`, `dateStart`, `dateEnd`, `target`, `simulation`, `tz_offset`.

`simulation` accepts `all`, `live`, or `simulated`; unknown values behave like `all`.

## Decisions

- `simulation` accepts `all`, `live`, or `simulated`; unknown values behave like `all`.

## Cleanup and Cache

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

Bulk delete and cleanup responses use:

```json
{
  "requested_alerts": 0,
  "requested_decisions": 0,
  "deleted_alerts": 0,
  "deleted_decisions": 0,
  "failed": [],
  "ip": "1.2.3.4"
}
```

`ip` is only included for cleanup-by-IP responses.

## Stats and Dashboard

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

- `simulation` accepts `all`, `live`, or `simulated`.
- `granularity=hour` returns hourly buckets; any other value uses daily buckets.

## CrowdSec Metrics

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/metrics/crowdsec` | Fetch and normalize CrowdSec Prometheus metrics. Returns `404` when `CROWDSEC_PROMETHEUS_URL` is not configured and `502` when the metrics fetch fails. |

The response includes `fetched_at`, `totals`, `bouncers`, `machines`, `parserSources`, `parserNodes`, `whitelists`, and `parserTimings`. It can also include runtime-only observability sections: `lapiRoutes` and `appsecEngines`.

Parser node entries include `isChild`, which is `true` for CrowdSec child parser nodes emitted with the `child-` prefix.

Parser, LAPI latency, AppSec, bouncer, and machine values are derived from the current CrowdSec Prometheus scrape. The endpoint does not query Prometheus history or calculate Grafana-style `rate()`/`increase()` windows, so metrics that require time-window tracking are intentionally omitted.

## Notifications

Notification inbox routes operate on generated notification items.
